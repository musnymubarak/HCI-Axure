# Calculator Prototype - Axure

## Overview

This project is a basic calculator prototype designed using Axure RP. The prototype provides interactive number buttons that allow users to engage with the interface but does not perform actual calculations. This serves as an initial step toward a fully functional calculator.

## Features

- Interactive number buttons for user input

- Basic UI layout mimicking a standard calculator

- User-friendly interface for seamless interaction

## Tools & Technologies

- Axure RP: Used for designing and prototyping the calculator UI

## Installation & Usage

- Download & Install Axure RP if not already installed.

- Open the .rp file in Axure RP.

- Preview the prototype by selecting Preview or exporting it to HTML.

- Click on the number buttons to interact with the prototype.

## Future Enhancements

- Implementation of mathematical operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division)

- UI improvements with better styling and animations

- Support for decimal inputs and clear/reset functionality
